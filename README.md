# Long term stock price prediction

A project in Long term stock prediction.
Based on [Long Term Stock Prediction Based On Financial
Statements Paper](http://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_winter_2021/reports/70728801.pdf), [tradeX Github](https://github.com/saic-mdal/lama).


In this project we aim to extended [Original Paper](http://cs230.stanford.edu/projects_winter_2021/reports/70728801.pdf) goals. We aim to predict 2 the stock price 2 years into the future based on a 5 years of historical financial Indicators

In our Project we use [Quandl Sharadar Dataset](https://data.nasdaq.com/databases/SF1/) to get the historical financial indicators instead of web scraping like the original paper. The Dataset is a **Premium Dataset** meaning you are going to need to pay for a license for using the dataset before continuing.
